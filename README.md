# ESP32 FastLED BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
**Functional BLE fork of https://github.com/jasoncoon/esp32-fastled-ble**

Note: All my coding is self taught. Things might get funky here.

## Features
### Currently Working:
* [x] DemoReel100 patterns
* [x] [Sam's multi-core support](https://github.com/samguyer/FastLED/blob/master/examples/DemoReelESP32/DemoReelESP32.ino)
* [x] Setting storage in EEPROM
* [x] Ability to adjust these settings via BLE:
   * [x] power on/off
   * [x] brightness
   * [x] pattern
   * [ ] autoplay on/off
   * [ ] autoplay duration
   * [x] speed
   * [x] palette
   * [ ] auto palette cycling
   * [x] palette duration
   * [x] solid color
   * [x] twinkle speed/density
   * [x] fire cooling/sparking

### To-do:
* [ ] On-the-fly programming
   * [ ] Set up code to recieve large (>512 bytes) of information to store into EEPROM in order to send an array of colors.
   * [ ] Make a looping "pattern" that decodes the complete bitmap into fastLED.
* [ ] Adjustable Strobe mode

## Requirements

### Hardware

#### ESP32 Development Board

[An ESP32 development board of your choice](https://www.google.com/search?q=esp32+development+board)

The code here is debugged on an ESP32-PICO kit.

#### Addressable LED strip

The code may be easily modified to run any configuration supported by FastLED; however, it will be debugged on a single WS2812B strip.

#### Other hardware:

* [3.3V to 5V Logic Level Shifter](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/SN74HCT245N/296-1612-5-ND/277258) (required if LEDs "glitch")
* [Octo Level Shifter FeatherWing](https://www.evilgeniuslabs.org/level-shifter-featherwing) (tidy level shifter PCB)

Recommended by [Adafruit NeoPixel "Best Practices"](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/best-practices) to help protect LEDs from current onrush:
* [1000ÂµF Capacitor](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/panasonic-electronic-components/ECA-1EM102/P5156-ND/245015)
* [300 to 500 Ohm resistor](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stackpole-electronics-inc/CF14JT470R/CF14JT470RCT-ND/1830342)

### Software
